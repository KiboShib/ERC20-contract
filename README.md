First AI-generated Meme Coin

It was all started as a joke, but the idea which was proposed by the AI is so powerful that nobody could resist!

An AI chat was asked if it could generate a meme coin which is the child of Kabosu (DOGE) as the mother and Shiba Inu (SHIB) as the father. And it did a surprisingly good job. Just take a look at the response yourself. It’s a unique ticker, sounds cool and catchy, and has a clear idea behind it with features in mind.

The AI even suggested a logo design which later has been fed to the Dall-E AI picture generator.

Simply WOW! Or WOOF! The world’s first AI-generated Meme Coin $KIBSHI has officially been born. Let it be a reminder that whether created by AI or humans, Meme Coins are for the community to enjoy and have fun.

I leave AI meme coin KiboShib, first child of DOGE and SHIB, in your hands.
